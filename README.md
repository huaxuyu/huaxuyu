# Hi, I'm Huaxu Yu ðŸ‘‹

I am a chemist and software developer with a strong focus on mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. My work integrates analytical chemistry, instrumentation, computer science and bioinformatics to develop innovative tools that can (1) produce high-quality MS data and (2) transform raw data into meaningful biological insights.
